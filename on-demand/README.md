# Bot to scrape on-demand info from premium movie channels

This was my first bot (embarrassingly, written in Matlab) that scrapes 
on-demand movie info, i.e. name, cast, synopsis, run-time, from the 
websites of premium cable channels, including HBO, Showtime, Starz, and 
Encore and parses them into an HTML table and gets links to movie trailers 
from youtube and the downloads the movie cover image from IMDB or TMDB. 
An html file with hyperlinks to the corresponding trailer is uploaded onto 
a webserver.  This script was written in 2012, so it is outdated. 
Moreover, the webserver is down. Damn you Optimum!

The main file is: GenerateHTMLwImages.m

Cheers!
