# one-on-one blackjack game (Matlab)

This is a Matlab game to play vegas-style blackjack against a dealer. 
The player can place desired bets and play 6 deck blackjack in a 
one-on-one game against the dealer. Hints for what to do in each 
situation is also provided. This is a nice way to visualize cards 
and practice counting without having to do lots of shuffling and track
your profits-and-losses. Also, one can run simulations of betting 
strategies.
